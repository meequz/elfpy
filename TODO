- Make these two lines one:
```
test called test.A()
test called test.A(140379755009584).__init__()
```

- Add tests
- Check when code is in __init__.py file
- Check for static methods
- Recognize when single function performs return (do we really need it?)
- Add visualization (if we invent something interesting and useful)
- NovelFormatter may have much more beautiful output
- Make a setting to toggle exclusion of a standart lib
- Django support
